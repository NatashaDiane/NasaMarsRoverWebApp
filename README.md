# NasaMarsRoverWebApp - SpringBoot ‚≠ê

Application characteristics: 
 - Integrates with NASA's open API's to get all the Images taken by all the rovers on Mars and at the same time get the latest Mars weather report.
 - This Web app uses Spring boot for fast auto configuration, Thymeleaf for building dynamic web contents and Bootstrap to create a responsive user interface.

*Still work in progress, and waiting for the images taken by NASA's 4th rover 'Perseverance' to be available.
